KeepLane
--------
  Next state:
    KeepLane
      Possible environment situations:
        There is no vehicle ahead -> KeepLane at max speed
        There is a vehicle ahead
          Safe distance -> KeepLane at max speed
          Not safe distance
            heading vehicle is driving at max speed -> KeepLane but speed down to keep a safe distance
            heading vehicle is driving at a low speed (lower than the desired minimum) -> PrepareChangeLane Right/Left
        
          Far (distance is safe) -> KeepLane at max speed
          Near -> PrepareChangeLane Right/Left
            speeding down
            at max speed
              distance is safe -> KeepLane at max speed
              distance isn't safe -> KeepLane but speed down
                
            
      Conditions:
